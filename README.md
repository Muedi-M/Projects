# Projects

Thank you for taking you time to browse through my repo. These are some of the projects I have done, through tutorials and just pure curiosity into applications of Data Science, excel, and various other technologies in certain fields.

My aim is to try and do at least one project a day(wellllll, that didn't stick, I meant at least write code everyday(This sticked)), inorder for me to solidify my  skills. Thank you once again.

#NB: I am still new at this. Feel free to reach out if theres any suggestions or comments.
