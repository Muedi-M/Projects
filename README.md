# Projects

Thank you for taking you time to browse through my repo. This are some of the projects I have done, through tutorials and just pure curiosity into applications of Data Science in certain fields.

My aim is to try and do at least one project a day, inorder for me to solidify my Data Science skills. Thank you once again.

#NB: I am still new at this. Feel free to reach out if theres any suggestions or comments.
